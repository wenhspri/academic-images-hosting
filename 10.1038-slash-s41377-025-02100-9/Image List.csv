Fig 1,"Fig. 1 Performance radar chart and experimental setup of OEIM. a Performance radar chart illustrating the capabilities of OEIM, see Supplementary
Table S3 for detailed comparison with other systems. b Schematic of the experimental setup. Ising spins are represented by the binary phase of OEPO
pulses, and arbitrary connections between spins are established via an FPGA-based feedback loop. Key components include MZM (Mach-Zehnder
modulator), SOA (semiconductor optical ampliﬁer), SMF (single-mode ﬁber), PD (photodetector), EA (electrical ampliﬁer), LO (local oscillator), BPF
(bandpass ﬁlter), LPF (lowpass ﬁlter), ADC (analog-to-digital converter), FPGA (ﬁeld-programmable gate array), and DAC (digital-to-analog converter)",https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/wenhspri/academic-images-hosting@paper/10.1038-slash-s41377-025-02100-9/Fig%201.png
Fig 2,"Fig. 2 Solving the MAX CUT problem with OEIM and comparison with SA. a Evolution of spin amplitude with increasing number of circulations
for the I4096 problem. Inset shows rapid bifurcation of Ising spins at the onset of evolution. b Temporal evolution of the cut value obtained by OEIM
(red curve) and SA in speed mode (blue curve) for the I4096 problem. The dashed line indicates the target value (90,984) attained by SG3 (see
Supplementary Section 5). c Time-to-target for 4096-node graphs under varying graph densities (1%, 10%, 50%, 100%) using OEIM and SA in speed
mode. d Histogram of cut values obtained by OEIM and SA in accuracy mode for the I4096 problem. The best and mean cut values achieved by OEIM
are 98,236 and 96,794, respectively, while those for SA are 97,564 and 95,731",https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/wenhspri/academic-images-hosting@paper/10.1038-slash-s41377-025-02100-9/Fig%202.png
Fig 3,"Fig. 3 Stable oscillation time of OEIM. a Temporal variation in the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r of OEIM, with characteristic points marked in

Fig 4,"Fig. 4 Solving process for general COP and trafﬁc optimization problems. 1 Mapping of the COP to the Ising model. 2 Loading the J matrix
from the Ising model into OEIM via FPGA. 3 Evolution of OEIM to obtain the Ising spin set. 4 Mapping the Ising spin set back to the COP to yield the
optimized solution. For trafﬁc optimization, data from the T-Drive dataset is used, the UE model is converted to an Ising model, and the optimized
solution represents the optimal trafﬁc diversion plan",https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/wenhspri/academic-images-hosting@paper/10.1038-slash-s41377-025-02100-9/Fig%204.png
